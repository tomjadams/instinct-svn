Specification runner refactoring
1. Create new specification methods with runners internally (may need to break out the normal spec method runner).
2. Create SpecificationRunStatus implementations for all spec methods.
3. Hook into old specification runner.
4. Remove OldDodgySpecificationMethodImpl.
5. Remove com.googlecode.instinct.internal.runner.OldDodgySpecificationRunnerImpl.
6. The context class should be built using new spec methods, then they can just be run and aggregated. 
7. Clean up junit3.SpecificationTestCase and junit4.SpecificationRunnerImpl around failing & pending specs.
8. Ensure command line, Ant, etc. runners get pending reason emitted.

Reductio integration
1. Full support for roperties (methods, fields, etc.), should detect & run them.
2. Simplification of property parameters (no. tests, etc.) - if neccessary.
