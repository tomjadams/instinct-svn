* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired
by RSpec, Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications
and actors; automatic creation of test doubles and test subjects; a state and
behaviour expectation API; JUnit test runner integration; Ant support and an
IntelliJ IDEA plugin.

* Distribution Contents *

The distribution contains the following contents:

o README                            - This readme file.
o LICENCE                           - Instinct licence file.
o NOTICE                            - Licence notices for libraries used in Instinct.
o RELEASE-NOTES                     - Release notes for this & previous releases.
o instinct-<version>.jar            - Instinct Jar file, source code is included in the
                                      Jar for convenience.
o instinct-<version>-javadoc.jar    - Instinct API javadoc (does not include internal API).
o lib/                              - Libraries required by Instinct at runtime (including
                                      licences), see below for details.

Instinct depends on the following libraries at runtime.

o boost-982.jar
o cglib-nodep-2.2_beta1.jar
o hamcrest-all-1.1.jar
o jmock-2.2.0.jar
o jmock-legacy-2.2.0.jar
o objenesis-1.0.jar

In addition, to use the Instinct Ant task, you'll need:

o ant-1.7.0.jar

In addition, to use the JUnit 3/4 runners, you'll need:

o junit-4.4.jar


* Documentation *

* Package Structure *

Instinct is organised into published APIs and internal packages. You should use
the published API when using Instinct. However, you are welcome to use the
internal classes, though relying on the internal APIs is not advised as they
will change from release to release.


Published packages

com.googlecode.instinct.expect
  Expectation API -Includes support for setting state & behaviour expectations.

com.googlecode.instinct.integrate
  Integration with other tools such as JUnit and Ant.

com.googlecode.instinct.marker
  Annotations and naming conventions for making code available to Instinct.


Internal packages

com.googlecode.instinct.internal
  All classes in this package are internal Instinct APIs. Relying on them is not
  recommended.

com.googlecode.instinct.sandbox
  New ideas, not ready for production usage. You are strongly advised not to
  use this code.


Plug-in Points

com.googlecode.instinct.report
  Context result reporting.

com.googlecode.instinct.runner
  Context runners for running Instinct contexts outside of the provided Ant,
  JUnit or IDE runners.


* Source *

Source code is available within the distribution Jars. Complete source is
available at: http://instinct.googlecode.com/

To build from source, Instinct requires Ant 1.7.0 and JUnit 4.4.

Shell scripts for Unix & Windows systems are provided in the project's root
directory. These do not require any other dependencies and can be run standalone.

To use a default Ant installation, you will need to add the JUnit jar to
ANT_HOME/lib directory.
