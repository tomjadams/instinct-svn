Prod code

- User-facing code goes into top level packages, internal code belongs in internal.
  It's OK if external code returns internal implementations. Prefer to return external
  interfaces though.
- There is no IoC container, play around if you want to use constructor injection,
  or use manual field injection. Avoid setter injection.
- Prefer interfaces for all classes.
- Try to write real objects, not procedural code.
- Reject nulls. Don't return them, don't use them (some external libraries like them).
- Prefer "immutable" classes. Don't use setters that allow an object to be set up in
  a bad state, only use them for optional fields or where the usage requires
  mutability.
- Use final on local variables and parameters.
- Make all classes final, unless they've been designed for inheritance.

Test code

- Don't add methods to the super class test case. Prefer static imports.
- Use the SubjectCreator to create test subjects. This will handle dependencies.
- Ensure code is policy checked (nulls, finals, etc.).
