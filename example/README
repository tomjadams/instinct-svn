This package contains examples of:
* Defining specifications in a baseclass and having them run when a suclass is
  run.
* Defining a @BeforeSpecification method in a baseclass and having it run before
  each specification in the subclass and baseclass (if any).
* Overriding a @BeforeSpecification in a subclass (overriding the base class
  version).
* Defining @AfterSpecification methods in both a baseclass and a subclass and
  having them both run when the subclass spec is run.
* Use of private lifecycle methods.
