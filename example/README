* Defining a @BeforeSpecification method in a baseclass and having it run before
  each specification in the subclass and baseclass (if any).
* Overriding a @BeforeSpecification in a subclass (overriding the base class version).
* Defining @AfterSpecification methods in both a baseclass and a subclass and having 
  them both run when the subclass spec is run.
* Use of private lifecycle methods.
