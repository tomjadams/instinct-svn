This package contains examples of:

1. Defining specifications in a baseclass and having them run when a suclass is run.
2. Defining a @BeforeSpecification method in a baseclass and having it run before each specification in the subclass and baseclass (if any).
3. Overriding a @BeforeSpecification in a subclass (overriding the base class version).
4. Defining @AfterSpecification methods in both a baseclass and a subclass and having them both run when the subclass spec is run.
5. Use of private lifecycle methods.
