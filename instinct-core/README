* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired by RSpec,
Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications, mocks, etc.
(via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming conventions); automatic
creation of mocks, stubs, test subjects & unique fields; a verification API
(similar to JUnit's Assert); unique utilities; and JUnit test runner integration.


* Binaries *

Instinct is bundled as a single Jar file: instinct.jar.

Source code is included in the Jar for convenience (TODO add this!).
