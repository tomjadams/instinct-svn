* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired
by RSpec, Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications,
mocks, etc. (via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming conventions);
automatic creation of test doubles (dummies, mocks & stubs) & test subjects; a
verification API (similar to JUnit's Assert); and JUnit test runner integration.


* Distribution Contents *

The distribution contains the following contents:

o README                    - This readme file.
o LICENCE                   - Instinct licence file.
o NOTICE                    - Licence notices for libraries used in Instinct.
o RELEASE-NOTES             - Release notes for this & previous releases.
o instinct-<version>.jar    - Instinct Jar file, source code is included in the Jar for convenience.
o lib/                      - Libraries required by Instinct at runtime, see below for details.
o docs/api/                 - Instinct API javadoc (does not include internal API).

Instinct depends on the following libraries at runtime.

o boost-982.jar
o cglib-nodep-2.2_beta1.jar
o jmock-1.1.0.jar
o jmock-cglib-1.1.0.jar
o easymockclassextension-2.2.jar

In addition, to use the Instinct Ant task, you'll need:

o ant-1.7.0.jar

In addition, to use the JUnit 4 runners, you'll need:

o junit-4.1.jar
