* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired by RSpec,
Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications, mocks, etc.
(via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming conventions); automatic
creation of mocks, stubs, test subjects & unique fields; a verification API
(similar to JUnit's Assert); unique utilities; and JUnit test runner integration.


* Distribution Contents *

The distribution contains the following contents:

o ...
o lib


(TODO: Add a listing of contents)

Instinct is bundled as a single Jar file: instinct-<version>.jar, source code is
included in the Jar for convenience.

Instinct depends on the following runtime libraries, packaged within the "lib" directory.

o boost-982.jar
o cglib-nodep-2.2_beta1.jar
o jmock-1.1.0.jar
o jmock-cglib-1.1.0.jar
o easymockclassextension-2.2.jar

In addition, to use the Instinct Ant task, you'll need:

o ant-1.7.0.jar

In addition, to use the JUnit 4 runners, you'll need:

o junit-4.1.jar
