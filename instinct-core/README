* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired
by RSpec, Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications,
test actors, etc. (via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming
conventions); automatic creation of test doubles (dummies, mocks & stubs) &
test subjects; state and behavioural (mocks) expectation API; JUnit test runner
integration & Ant tasks.
