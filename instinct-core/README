* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired
by RSpec, Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications,
test actors, etc. (via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming
conventions); automatic creation of test doubles (dummies, mocks & stubs) &
test subjects; state and behavioural (mocks) expectation API; JUnit test runner
integration & Ant tasks.

o README                            - This readme file.
o LICENCE                           - Instinct licence file.
o NOTICE                            - Licence notices for libraries used in Instinct.
o RELEASE-NOTES                     - Release notes for this & previous releases.
o instinct-<version>.jar            - Instinct Jar file, source code is included in the
                                      Jar for convenience.
o instinct-<version>-javadoc.jar    - Instinct API javadoc (does not include internal API).
                                      Jar for convenience.
o lib/                              - Libraries required by Instinct at runtime (including
                                      licences), see below for details.

Instinct depends on the following libraries at runtime.

o boost-982.jar
o cglib-nodep-2.2_beta1.jar
o jmock-core-1.2.0.jar
o jmock-cglib-1.2.0.jar
o jmock-2.0.0.jar
o easymockclassextension-2.2.jar

In addition, to use the Instinct Ant task, you'll need:

o ant-1.7.0.jar

In addition, to use the JUnit 3/4 runners, you'll need:

o junit-4.3.1.jar

Thanks to the work done on RSpec, jMock, EasyMock, Boost & JRDF. These libraries
inspired Instinct. Thanks also to the EasyDoc team, past & present, your work is
inspirational.
