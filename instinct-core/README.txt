* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired by RSpec,
Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications, mocks, etc.
(via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming conventions); automatic
creation of mocks, stubs, test subjects & unique fields; a verification API
(similar to JUnit's Assert); unique utilities; and JUnit test runner integration.

* Binaries*

Instinct is bundled as a single Jar file: instinct.jar.

Source code is included in the Jar for convenience (TODO add this!).


* Dependencies *

Instinct depends on the following runtime libraries:

o boost-982.jar
o easymockclassextension-2.2.jar

Also, all libraries in the lib directory are used at build time.

Thanks to the work done on RSpec, jMock EasyMock, Boost & JRDF. These libraries
inspired Instinct.
